kraftwerk
=========

Kraftwerk is an MVC PHP, rails inspired framework. It allows a robust rails-like PHP MVC framework to 
be used on a LAMP server without being forced to learn or install ruby. It can be run on any host 
that has PHP 5.0 and MySQL 5.0 installed.

Kraftwerk is currently in development stages, and is BARELY considered alpha. In the coming weeks we will be 
migrating more and more of the code into the repository and the framework will become more and more functional 
as time goes on. Currently the framework supports models and is minimally functional.
