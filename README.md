kraftwerk
=========

Kraftwerk is an MVC PHP framework that combines the ease of use of Rails with the flexibility of PHP. 
It is the answer to PHP users who wish to have a robust rails-like PHP MVC framework without being forced
to learn or install ruby. It can be run on any host that has PHP 5.0 and MySQL 5.0 installed.

Kraftwerk is currently in development stages, and is BARELY alpha. In the coming weeks we will be migrating
more and more of the code into the repository and the framework will become more and more functional as time
goes on. Currently the framework supports models and is minimally functional.
